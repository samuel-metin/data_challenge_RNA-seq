# Data camp M2DS: single-cell type classification challenge

See the following starting kit scMARK_classification_starting_kit for the `scMARK_classification` challenge: classification of cell-types with single-cell RNAseq count data. It explains the dataset and it gives a first classifier as an example.

The code we had to submit on RAMP had to be a Python class called Classifier with a method called predict_proba(). 
You can see the results of the 2 classifiers of my group in the file 'Data_camp_presentation.pdf'.

Globally, we have got these competitive results thanks to hierarchical classification, relevant preprocessing and balancing the classes.
